Weir
=======================

Components:
Reader - main class instantiates others
Hound - fetches RSS on a timer, dispatches events with new counts when the fetch concludes
Database.js - tech-specific database layer, start with pgsql
Console - logs out to a file (eventually) or to stdout (currently)
Config - key/value store loaded from JSON
Server - HTTP requests and AJAX calls
Stream - Registers routes and passes on to the database
Manos - utility functions for async without importing all of caolan's library
Freedom - import/export, starting with OPML
Security - Manage sessions, TOTP authorization

Notes (vaguely ordered):

 - Mark as read on activation
 - Add a scroll handling service, remove logic from the StreamController
  - activate on scroll
  - scroll to top based on events
  - trigger deferred processing
  - automatically throttle scroll events
 - invent real dialog service for TOTP entry, alerts
 - Turn on error output for ask(), Stream
 - Move fetch loop into the Hound proper
 - Refine stream styles
 - Use accent for various UI elements
 - Show unread items since last full refresh with a highlight
 - Add feed management (subscribing, at least, if not unsubscribing and renaming)
 - Add ability to write config file with .save();
 - Add some local style removal to Weir.Sanitize
 - Allow Weir.Sanitize to resize elements if they would be too big (scale movies, etc)
 - reconsider general AJAX API, flow
 - Add to options service
  - security - get a random key (possibly set it as well)
  - key remapping or compatibility
  - list length
  - infinite scroll?
  - visual theme colors? (from a palette)
  - refresh rate
  - should buttons mark all or just refresh?
 - Add tags
 - Configure router to support REST params
